#  Ames Housing Price Prediction

This project aims to build a complete machine learning regression pipeline to predict house sale prices using the Ames Housing Dataset. It demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and insights visualization.

##  Dataset
- **Name**: Ames Housing Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset)  
- **Shape**: 2930 rows × 82 columns

---

##  Project Objectives
1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the data.
2. Apply **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing** (handle missing values, transform data).
3. Conduct **Feature Engineering** to improve model performance.
4. Build baseline and advanced **Regression Models**.
5. Tune model performance using **Hyperparameter Optimization**.
6. **Evaluate and Interpret** the model using metrics and visualizations.

## Objective

- Explore the dataset and understand key relationships through EDA
- Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, convert types)
- Engineer and select optimized features
- Train and evaluate regression models (Linear Regression, etc.)
- Fine-tune models using hyperparameter optimization
- Interpret results and derive insights through visualizations 


##  How to Run

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/lakshit2234/Ames-Housing-Price-Prediction.git
